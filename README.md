1. **Introduction:**
   - Developed a Tic Tac Toe game for a Java web development internship.To develop a Tic Tac Toe game, several key logic components must be implemented. First, the game board is typically represented as a 3x3 grid, often using arrays or other data structures. Players take turns marking the grid with their respective symbols, usually X and O. The game logic includes checking for winning conditions after each move, where a player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Additionally, the game checks for a draw condition if all squares are filled without a winner. User input handling is crucial, ensuring that player moves are valid and within the bounds of the grid. Managing the game state, including tracking the current player and the state of the board, is essential for determining the game's outcome. Finally, updating the display to reflect changes in the game board after each move completes the logic, providing players with a seamless gaming experience. By integrating these logic components, a functional and enjoyable Tic Tac Toe game can be created.

2. **Technologies Used:**
   - Java, Servlets/JSP, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Apache Tomcat.

3. **Game Design and Logic:**
   - Designed 3x3 grid, alternating X and O turns, win conditions.
   - Implemented game logic in Java classes.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Created UI with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
   - Used AJAX for server communication.

5. **Server-side Logic:**
   - Managed server-side logic with Java servlets/JSP.
   - Handled requests, updated game state, sent responses.

6. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Tested functionality, debugged issues.

Here is how it works
1.You need to start the game

2.Then it will ask you whether you want to play first or let the computer make the first move

4.In the End result would be declared who is the winner or is it a Tie match
